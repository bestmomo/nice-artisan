## Description

The `schedule:finish` command is an **internal Artisan command** used by Laravel's scheduling engine when running scheduled tasks via the database or Redis driver. Its primary role is to **update the job status** after a scheduled task has completed.

When tasks are dispatched from the scheduler, they can be processed as queued jobs using the `->onQueue()` or `->onConnection()` methods. The `schedule:finish` command is executed as a final step in the queue job's lifecycle to mark the scheduled task as complete, allowing the scheduler to correctly track its execution history.

**Note:** You rarely, if ever, need to run this command manually. It is automatically triggered by Laravel's internal queue system to manage task completion status.
