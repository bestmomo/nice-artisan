## Description

The `route:clear` command is an Artisan utility in Laravel used to **remove the compiled route cache file** generated by the `php artisan route:cache` command.

If your application is using route caching (typically in production) and you make changes to any of your route files (`routes/*.php`), you must run this command *before* running `route:cache` again, or during local development if you want to ensure the routes are being loaded from the raw PHP files. Running this command ensures that the application will re-read and compile all route definitions from your source files on the next request.
