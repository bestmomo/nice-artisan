## Description

The `stub:publish` command is an Artisan utility in Laravel used to **copy the default stub files** used by Laravel's code generators (the `make:` commands) into your application's root directory.

A **stub** is a template file (e.g., the basic template for a new Controller or Model). When you run a command like `php artisan make:model Post`, Laravel uses the internal model stub file. By running `stub:publish`, you can copy all these stubs into a **`stubs`** directory at the root of your project.

Once published, you can **edit these stub files** to customize the default structure, methods, or headers of files generated by Artisan, ensuring they match your project's coding standards or required base classes.
