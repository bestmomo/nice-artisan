## Description

The `optimize:clear` command is an Artisan utility in Laravel that is primarily used to **remove all compiled and cached performance files** generated by the `optimize` process, which typically includes the configuration and route caches.

In modern Laravel versions (since 5.5), this command acts as a convenient alias to clear the most common optimization caches in a single operation:

1.  **Configuration Cache:** Clears the compiled configuration file.
2.  **Route Cache:** Clears the compiled route definition file.
3.  **View Cache:** Clears all compiled Blade templates.

It is generally run after deployment or when switching between environments (e.g., from production to local development) to ensure the application loads the latest, unoptimized file versions.
