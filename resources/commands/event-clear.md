## Description

The `event:clear` command is a Laravel Artisan utility used to **delete the compiled manifest** of application events and their associated listeners.

This manifest is generated by the `php artisan event:cache` command and is stored in a file (e.g., `events.php`) within the `bootstrap/cache` directory.

The command is typically run during development or after a deployment where an event or listener has been added, removed, or modified, to ensure the application uses the latest changes rather than the outdated cached map.

## Usage

The command takes no arguments or options and performs a simple file deletion.

### Command Structure

`php artisan event:clear`

### Key Behavior

1. **Deletes the File**: It removes the `events.php` file from `bootstrap/cache`.
2. **Reverts to Reflection**: Once the cache is cleared, the framework will revert to using PHP reflection to discover all events and listeners defined in the `EventServiceProvider` on every request.
3. **Optimization Follow-up**: To re-optimize your application after clearing, you should run `php artisan event:cache` again.

## Practical Examples

**Clear the cached events**:

`php artisan event:clear`

_(Output: "Events cache cleared successfully!")_

**Full Event Cache Workflow (Change, Clear, Rebuild):**

1 . **Clear the old cache**:
`php artisan event:clear`

2 . **Rebuild the new, optimized cache**:
`php artisan event:cache`
